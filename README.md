# gaana-downloader
Python script to download songs from gaana

## Installation
- **This tool supports only Python 3**

### Debian, Ubuntu, Linux & Mac

```
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/ns23/gaana-downloader.git
$ cd gaana-downloader
$ pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

**Important:** if you have installed both Python 2 and 3, the `pip` command
could invoke an installation for Python 2. To see which Python version `pip`
refers to, try `$ pip -V`. If it turns out `pip` is your Python 2 pip, try
`$ pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt` instead.
